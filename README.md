### A duck and pelican FEEDING game for APCS with a possible Arduino Wii component. 

DUCK FEED FOR LIFE!

## How to run the Java code

### Set up core.java
Under the **Java Projects** dropdown menu in the VSCode sidebar, add core.java as a new library. This will allow Processing to be used as a graphics program for your code. Click the **+** sign under **Java Dependencies** and navigate to that file.

### Set up the other stuff
Repeat the above process for the graphics libraries, which should be in the same folder as core.java, which is located in a subfolder of the **Processing** folder of your computer. 

### Downgrade Java :(
If you have JDK-11, delete that and make sure you have JDK-8 instead. 

### That's it!

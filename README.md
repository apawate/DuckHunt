DUCK FEED FOR LIFE!

## How to run the Java code

### Set up core.java
Under the **Java Projects** dropdown menu in the VSCode sidebar, add core.java as a new library. This will allow Processing to be used as a graphics program for your code. Click the **+** sign under **Java Dependencies** and navigate to that file.

To find `core.java`, look inside the Processing folder in your Documents or Downloads, and then click into the `core` folder and click some more until you find it.

### Set up the other stuff
Repeat the above process for the graphics libraries, which should be in the same folder as core.java, which is located in a subfolder of the **Processing** folder of your computer. Add all the jogl and gluegen jars. If you run into problems, feel free to leave an issue on the GitHub or contact us at [this link](mailto:apawate739@student.fuhsd.org)!

### Downgrade Java :(
If you have JDK-11, delete that and make sure you have JDK-8 instead. For some unknown reason, Processing will not compile when used with the JDK-11. Don't worry, it shouldn't be _too_ hard to get it back... This might be a bit hard, so if you need help feel free to search online or contact us at the link above.

### That's it!
